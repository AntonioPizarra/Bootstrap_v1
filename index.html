                The UEFA Champions League (historically known as the European Cup and mostly abbreviated worldwide as the UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). It is contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It is the most watched club competition in the world and the third-most watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

                        The first European Cup took place during the 1955-56 season. Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Stade de Reims (France), and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).

                        <br><br>

                        The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3-3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan. The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP. The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956. The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4-3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial. Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina. After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians. In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise. The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season

                        The 1967-68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4-1 in the final. This final came 10 years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life. In the 1968-69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4-1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.

                        <br><br>

                        The 1969-70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round, before beating Celtic in the final. In the 1970-71 season Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final. the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final. It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season. Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.

                        <br><br>

                        The following seasons saw victories in 1978-79 and 1979-80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982.

                        In 1992 the UEFA European Champions League was formed. Previously the European Cup had been played on a knock-out basis, but it would now be based on groups, culminating in a final. The format and the number of clubs gradually expanded, which could include up to five clubs from one nation.

                        Football was the one form of popular culture that united Europe and the competitions development can be seen in light of increasing European integration. Both the Maastricht Treaty and Single European Act were signed in 1992.

                        Developments in European football mirrored those amongst English clubs before the Premier League broke away. In Europe one man at the helm was the media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, the AC Milan President and later prime minister of Italy.

                        In 1998 the threat of a European Super League emerged. UEFA responded by increasing the number of Champions League clubs to 32. Two years later fourteen of the richest clubs formed their own lobby group, the 'G-14' (later increased to 18 clubs) to pressurise UEFA and FIFA into further increasing their share of income from the Champions League and the World Cup finals.

                        These developments were beginning to change the landscape of European football. Across Europe, a growing gap developed in domestic leagues between the super-rich clubs who perennially played in the Champions League and who increasingly looked upon themselves as brands, and lesser clubs.

                <p>The tournament proper begins with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four. The draw to determine which teams go into each group is seeded based on teams' performance in UEFA competitions, and no group may contain more than one club from each nation. Each team plays six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format. The winning team and the runners-up from each group then progress to the next round. The third-placed team enters the UEFA Europa League.

                <br><br>

                For the next stage - the last 16 - the winning team from one group plays against the runners-up from another group, and teams from the same association may not be drawn against each other. From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw is entirely random, without association protection.

                <br><br>
            
                The group stage is played from September to December, whilst the knock-out stage starts in February. The knock-out ties are played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. The final is typically held in the last two weeks of May, or in the early days of June, which has happened in three consecutive odd-numbered years since 2015. In the 2019-20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August.</p>
